bjective:
Design and implement a simple calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Requirements:

The calculator should accept two numbers as input.

It should allow the user to select the desired operation (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division).

The calculator should display the result of the selected operation.

The program should handle invalid inputs gracefully.

The division operation should handle divide-by-zero cases with a proper message.


Optional Enhancements (for advanced version):

Allow continuous calculations until the user chooses to exit.

Support for more operations like modulus (%), power (^), etc.

Input validation to ensure users enter only numbers.
